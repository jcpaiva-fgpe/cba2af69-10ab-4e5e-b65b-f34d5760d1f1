# Climate Change Rate Calculator Calculate temperature changes and statistics: 1. Create an array of yearly temperatures: [14.8, 15.1, 15.4, 15.3, 15.7]

2. Calculate the year-over-year temperature changes 3. Calculate the percentage changes 4. Find the largest temperature increase **Note:** Use NumPy's built-in functions for calculations **Expected Output Format:** ```python Year-over-year changes: [0.3 0.3 -0.1 0.4]°C Percentage changes: [2.03% 1.99% -0.65% 2.61%] Largest increase: 0.4°C ``` **Required Libraries:** ```python import numpy as np ```
