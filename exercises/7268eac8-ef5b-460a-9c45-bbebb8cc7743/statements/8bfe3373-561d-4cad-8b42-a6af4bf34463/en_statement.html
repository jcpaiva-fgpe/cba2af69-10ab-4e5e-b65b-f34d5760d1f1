Create a comprehensive environmental monitoring system that combines everything you've learned. Your program should: 1. Data Collection and Storage: - Create a class EnvironmentalData that stores data for multiple climate indicators - Include methods to update measurements and calculate trends - Handle data from multiple sources (satellites, ground stations, ocean buoys) 2. Climate Analysis: - Implement methods to calculate: * Temperature anomalies and trends * Sea level rise rates * Greenhouse gas concentrations * Deforestation rates 3. Visualization Dashboard: - Create multiple subplot figures showing: * Global temperature map * Sea level trends * CO2 concentration graphs * Forest cover changes - Add interactive elements (zoom, hover tooltips) 4. Predictive Analytics: - Implement climate prediction models - Include uncertainty ranges - Add model performance metrics - Generate future scenarios 5. Alert System: - Create methods to detect anomalies - Implement early warning systems - Generate risk assessments - Send automated alerts Bonus: - Add data validation and quality control - Implement data backup and recovery - Add comprehensive documentation - Include example use cases
