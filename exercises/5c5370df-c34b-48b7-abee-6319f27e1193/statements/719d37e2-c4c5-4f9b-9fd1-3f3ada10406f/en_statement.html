# Ocean Temperature Analysis Using NumPy, analyze a week of ocean temperature readings: 1. Create a NumPy array with these daily temperatures: [25.2, 25.8, 26.1, 26.3, 26.8, 27.1, 27.3]

2. Calculate and print: - The highest temperature - The lowest temperature - The average temperature 3. Find which days had temperatures above 26.5Â°C (return boolean array) **Required Libraries:** ```python import numpy as np ```
