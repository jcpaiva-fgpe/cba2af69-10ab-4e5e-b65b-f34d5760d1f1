# Price Alert System Create a price alert system that: 1. Takes a target price of 45000 and current price of 46500

2. Uses boolean conditions to check if: - Current price is above target (print "Price above target") - Current price is below target (print "Price below target") - Current price equals target (print "Price at target") 3. Also check if the current price is within 1000 of target and print "Price near target" if true
