# Global Sensor Grid Transform sensor data for analysis: 1. Create a 1D array with 6 CO2 readings: [412, 415, 417, 411, 414, 419]

2. Reshape it into a 2x3 array (2 regions, 3 measurements each) 3. Calculate the average CO2 level for each region **Expected Output Format:** ```python CO2 Readings by Region: [[412 415 417] [411 414 419]] Regional Averages: [414.67 414.67] ``` **Required Libraries:** ```python import numpy as np ```
